# KDT7 Enterprise Project MN_VISION

## Project Overview
* Increased need for safety zone management across manufacturing industries due to strengthened Serious Accident Punishment Act
* Safety light curtains are installed and operated to detect workers entering the workspace of forklifts, which are essential for moving heavy or bulky materials, to manage worker safety
* Typically, when a forklift enters the workspace, the safety light curtains in the designated area do not operate, but are designed to detect intrusion by workers other than forklifts and stop the operation of related equipment through safety output
* Safety light curtain sensors detect objects based on whether the optical axis receives light when the transmitter and receiver are facing each other, so they cannot distinguish between forklifts and workers, causing safety output errors that lower work efficiency or increase safety accident risks
* This project involves building a solution that uses artificial intelligence with visual data to distinguish between forklifts and workers entering the workspace
